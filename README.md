# Udacity_Advanced_LaneLine_Finding
The second Project
This project is trying to combine different method together to make a better lane-line detection
The realizing steps are as follow:
1. using the chessboard image to calibration the camera
2.Using gradient threshold, color threshold method to deal with the pictures to get the binary image which contains the lane-line
3.Use the perspective transform to get the birds-eye view of the binary image
4.detect the pixels which belongs to the lane-line
5.Calculate the radius of the lane and the position of the car relative to the ceter of the road
6.deal with the pics and show the lane area in the image and also show the radius of the lane and the position of the vehicle.
